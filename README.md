This application is a quiz with a countdown timer. The user's score is based on the amount of time left after all the questions have been answered. A wrong answer substracts 15 seconds from the time remain and the score. If the timer runs out no score is recorded. If the user answers all the questions and there is time left on the counter, the score can be record with the users initials. The scores will be save in the session. The user has the option of clearing the scoreboard.
